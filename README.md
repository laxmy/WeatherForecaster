# Weather Forecaster Project

This project features a single page app that lets you add cities in U.S to a carousel and  shows weather forecast for five days. This uses weather data from openweathermap api. Every time you load the app in your browser, you can add cities to get the next five days forecast.

The goal of the project is to get a firm grasp of Redux Fundamentals and binding React and Redux in a single application, using middleware and third party libraries like Bootstrap for styling components. The project uses axios to fetch data via Ajax calls.
